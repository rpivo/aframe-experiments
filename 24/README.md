Use the View Select dropdown menu to see the scene at different vantage points. Objects can be deleted by selecting the object and hitting the delete key. Objects can be cloned from inside the scene hierarchy panel on the left side of the inspector. When objects are cloned, though, it doesn't look like the scene hierarchy is updated with this new object.
