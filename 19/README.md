## Experiment 19: three.js - The Scene Class

#### New to Me
- Scenes allow you to set up what and where is to be rendered by three.js.
- There are three built-in Scene classes: `Scene`, `Fog`, and `FogExp2`.
- The `Scene` class has a `background` property that can be used to set the background to a color or texture.
