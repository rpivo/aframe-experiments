## Experiment 10: The \<a-plane\> Object

#### New to Me
- The `<a-plane>` object creates a plane.
- The `width` property controls the plane's width.
- The `height` property controls the plane's height.

The `<a-plane>` object creates a plane. I don't think this plane can have depth since there is the `<a-box>` object, which is like `<a-plane>` but with depth. The size of the plane can be controlled with the `width` and `height` attributes.
