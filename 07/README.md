## Experiment 7: metalness, roughness, & wireframe Attributes

#### New to Me
- The `metalness` attribute is a value between 0 and 1 that determines how metallic the object's material is.
- The `roughness` attribute determine's how rough the material is from 0 to 1.
- The `wireframe` attribute shows just the object's wireframe when set to `true`.

The `metalness` attribute is a value between 0 and 1 that determines how metallic the object's material is. When this value is higher, the object seems to lose some of its original color, but will appear to have shinier properties. The `roughness` attribute determine's how rough the material is from 0 to 1. A rougher material will scatter reflected light in more directions than a smooth material. The `wireframe` attribute shows just the object's wireframe when set to `true`. When `wireframe` is set to `true`, the objects wireframes will still have the color that is set in the `color` attribute.
