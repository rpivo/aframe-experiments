## Experiment 5: The depth Attribute

#### New to Me
- The `<a-box>` object has a `depth` attribute that controls the geometric depth of the shape.
- `depth` can be an integer, a decimal float, or even a negative number.
- Setting `depth` to a negative number will exhibit strange shadowing properties.

The `<a-box>` object has a `depth` attribute that controls the geomtric depth of the shape. This allows the `<a-box>` object to have a lot of flexibility, shape-wise. It can be a box, a cube, a wall, a rectangle, etc. `depth` can be an integer, a decimal float, or even a negative number. Setting `depth` to a negative number will exhibit strange shadowing properties. It's possible that other aframe objects also have the `depth` attribute.
