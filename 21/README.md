## Experiment 21: More on the Entity Component System

#### New to Me
- "Composition Over Inheritance" is a common phrase used in OOP that also applies to ECS.
- It means that with the Entity Component System, we build for reusability, modularity, and polymorphic behavior.
- Adam Martin makes a distinction between "Entity Systems" and "Component Systems", and says that Entity Systems are a subset of "Component-Oriented Programming".

Adam Martin details the Entity Component System in this article: http://t-machine.org/index.php/2007/09/03/entity-systems-are-the-future-of-mmog-development-part-1/
