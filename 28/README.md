## Experiment 28: three.js - BoxGeometry

#### New to Me
- `BoxGeometry` is one of many built-in geometries in three.js.
- For a list of available geometries, see: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/src/geometries
- `BoxGeometry` is constructed with arguments `width`, `height`, and `depth`.

`BoxGeometry` is one of many built-in geometries in three.js. For a list of available geometries, see: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/src/geometries. `BoxGeometry` is constructed with arguments `width`, `height`, and `depth`. If these arguments aren't provided, then these will each default to `1`.
