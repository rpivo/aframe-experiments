## Experiment 23: The A-Frame Inspector

#### New to Me
- Dev tool for aframe that can be opened with `ctrl + alt + i`.
- Can show/hide details with **Inspect Scene/Back to Scene** buttons.
- Objects within this view are clickable and movable.

This seems like an incredibly powerful tool. Objects can be moved in 3D space using this tool, like using Cinema4D or Blender.
