## Experiment 6: The \<a-sphere\> Object

#### New to Me
- Spheres can be made using the `<a-sphere>` object.
- The size of the `<a-sphere>` can be controlled with its `radius` attribute.
- `radius` can be an integer, a decimal, or a negative number.

I can make spherical objects using the `<a-sphere>` object. The `<a-sphere>` object has a `radius` attribute that controls the sphere's size. `radius` can be an integer, a decimal float, or a negative number, much like `<a-box`'s depth. Setting `radius` to a negative number seems to invert the objects shading/shadowing properties.
