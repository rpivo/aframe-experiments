## Experiment 3: The rotation Attribute

#### New to Me
- An aframe object has a `rotation` attribute that gets set with three space-separated integers representing x (pitch), y (yaw), and z (roll).
- Like `position`, the x, y, and z values for `rotation` can be negative numbers.
- A `rotation` value of `0 0 0` effectively makes the object's rotation the same as the viewer.

I can change the x, y, and z (pitch, yaw, and roll, respectively) values for an object's `rotation` attribute to change the object's rotation. A rotation value of `0 0 0` effectively makes the object's rotation the same as the viewer.
