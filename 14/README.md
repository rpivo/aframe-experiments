## Experiment 14: The a-frame Boilerplate

#### New to Me
- This is the same scene as seen in the introductory Glitch example on the a-frame website.
- This package has been discontinued.
- Included in this boilerplate are a few other obscure a-frame packages: `aframe-example` and `aframe-scene`.

a-frame used to maintaing a package called a-frame Boilerplate, but it's since been discontinued in favor of using Glitch.
