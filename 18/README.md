## Experiment 18: Assets From the aframe CDN

#### New to Me
- Assets are available to use at https://cdn.aframe.io/.
- A floor texture is available at https://cdn.aframe.io/a-painter/images/floor.jpg.
- A sky texture is available at https://cdn.aframe.io/a-painter/images/sky.jpg.

Aside from the aframe bundle, cdn.aframe.io also serves assets that can be used within projects. A floor texture is available at https://cdn.aframe.io/a-painter/images/floor.jpg. A sky texture is available at https://cdn.aframe.io/a-painter/images/sky.jpg.
