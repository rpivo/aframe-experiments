## Experiment 26: Adding Components to the \<a-entity\> Object

#### New to Me
- Components can be added to an `<a-entity>` object to provide it functionality.
- The `geometry` and `material` components can be provided to an `<a-entity>` object to make it act like a primitive object.
- A full list of components and primitives can be found in the documentation: https://aframe.io/docs/1.0.0/introduction/.
