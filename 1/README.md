## Installing aframe and Its Types From NPM
### Experiment 1

#### New to Me
- installing the `aframe` NPM package in a Node project.
- TypeScript type declarations are available for `aframe` at `@types/aframe`.
- Typically, `aframe` is imported into a module as `AFRAME`.

I can use aframe inside a module by installing `aframe`. If I want to use this in a TypeScript environment, type declarations are also available at `@types/aframe`. Typically, `aframe` is imported into a module as `AFRAME`, similar to how three.js suggests importing their library.
