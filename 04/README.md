## Experiment 4: Object Color

#### New to Me
- An aframe object's color can be controlled from the `color` attribute.
- The `color` attribute can be set as a hexadecimal, as a CSS color name, or as an RGB color.
- The `color` attribute does not accept RGB with an alpha value (`rgba()`).

I can control an object's color with the `color` attribute. This value can be a hexidecimal, an RGB color, or a CSS color name. RGBA does not seem to work.
