## Experiment 11: Loading in Image Assets With \<a-asset\>

#### New to Me
- To load in an image asset, add an `<img />` tag to `<a-asset>` that contains `id` and `src` attributes.
- All assets loaded in from `<a-asset>` will not work locally unless you're using a local server.
- If setting an image on an `<a-plane>` object, the `<a-plane>` object must have a `height` and `width` in order to see the image.

More about the `<a-assets>` object: the scene wonâ€™t render or initialize until the browser fetches (or errors out) all the assets or the asset system reaches the timeout. Image assets can be loaded in by adding an `<img />` tag to the `<a-assets>` object.
