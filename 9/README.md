## Experiment 7: segments-radial, theta-start, & theta-length Attributes

#### New to Me
- The `segments-radial` attribute can be used on `<a-cylinder>` objects to convert the circular bases to n-gons.
- The `theta-start` attribute can be used in tandem with `theta-length`. This can be used to define the starting point of a partial circle.
- The `theta-length` attribute can be used in tandem with `theta-start`. This determines the rotational length of a partial (or possibly complete) circle.

I can use the `segments-radial` attribute on an `<a-cylinder>` object to convert the circular bases to n-gons. The `theta-start` attribute can be used in tandem with `theta-length`. This can be used to define the starting point of a partial circle. The `theta-length` attribute can be used in tandem with `theta-start`. This determines the rotational length of a partial (or possibly complete) circle.
